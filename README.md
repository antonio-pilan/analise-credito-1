# analise-credito-1
My first project as Data Scientist using Python's Scikit-Learn. Used a simple implementation of Decision Trees and KNN to analyse database and see which one is better for the case.

Decision Trees showed significantly better as expected for the case and, with this very simple code, we got around 83% hit rate.

This amazing result can show the power of Machine Learning in business and how it is used professionally.
